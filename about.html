                            There's nothing to be afraid of with trying after failing a lot of times. As it is better to regret that
                            you tried so hard than to regret that you've never tried at all. Remember that not it is not always you that
                            is the problem, sometimes things aren't just meant for us.

                            Parents worries about their child's ability to learn. Most of them words harder than others to increase
                            their child's intelligence through teaching them much more earlier. Although reading a child to sleep for others
                            might be just for fun, others also take it as a training for their child to understand better.
